      <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Itachi Uchiha was an unparalleled prodigy and ninja genius born into the prestigious Uchiha clan of the Hidden Leaf Village. Renowned across the shinobi world for his extraordinary skill and intellect, he mastered Genjutsu techniques to a supreme level, earning the revered title <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">God of Genjutsu</span>.  
        Despite his fearsome reputation and immense power, his life journey was defined by sacrifice, love, and complex moral choices that left an indelible mark on the ninja world.  
        <br/>
        He died at the young age of 21 due to the terminal illness he was secretly suffering from, combined with the strain of his overexertion during battles, overuse of his Mangekyo Sharingan and the last fight with his brother Sasuke in the Final Valley which ultimately led to his death—an outcome accepted quietly due to his unwavering dedication to protecting his village and brother.
